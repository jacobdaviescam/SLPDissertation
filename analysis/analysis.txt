From the generalistaion text:

Need to restrip the generalistaion script as some were wrong. 

1-6000 : The only inaccuracies are the incorrect labels of nmod:beside.

Really struggles when the RC modifies the subject rather than the object as is seen in training. 

10000: Incorrect 'to' head
11000: Incorrect punctuation head (sometimes correct - find the percentage)
12000: No errors
13000: 'obj' instead of 'iobj' in ditransitive
14000: struggles with 'who' as the iobj of ditransitive
16000: attributes 'who' as the obj of the main verb not the relative verb.
