    - [x] Questions with dangling 'to'
    - [x] Deal with passives
        - [x] Lemma of 'was' is 'be'

        - [x] Dictionary mapping first
    - [x] Deal with 'that'
    - [x] Deal with 'to'
    - [x] Deal with center embeddings
    - [x] Add code to convert each sentence in the dataset
    - [x] Add code to include the distribution and text of the sentence
    - [x] Punctuation
        - [x] Identify the main verb (the one that has no incoming edges)
    - [x] Unittests
    - [x] Sanity Checks
        - [x] Check that there is only one root
        - [x] Check that the length of forms, lemmas, pos, heads, deprel are the same
    - [ ] 'To' as mark is wrong in the generalisation dataset for RC_modif_iobj and Q_modified_NPs
- [ ] Alter the parser code
    - [ ] Add BERT embeddings
        - [ ] In the repo from Matthias
    - [x] Add a way to evaluate with respect to the distribution
        - [x] Line 179 in conll17_ud_eval.py - do we need to change this?
- [x] Write introduction chapter
- [ ] Write background chapter
    - [x] Contextual Embeddings
    - [x] Feature Representations
- [x] Conduct experiments for data collection
    - [x] Run experiments on Cirrus
        - [x] Start by running a parse of a subset of the dataset
        - [x] Write a slurm script
        - [x] Run the parser on the entire dataset
    - [x] Rerun the training on both the transition and graph based parsers - as there is an error with the training script. 
    - [x] Rerun the conversion on Q_long_mv as the punctuation is wrong in the gold.
        - [x] Find a way to get this type back into the generalisation dataset. 
    - [ ] Run the transition model with less and more stack elements
    - [x] Run the graph-based model and force projectivity
    - [ ] Run both graph and transition one more time and then average the result over the different seeds - report seeds for each random initialisation. 
    - [ ] Run the models with BERT embeddings
        - [ ] Try to use the GPU version of the model on cirrus to save resources
    - [ ] Run the models with the external embeddings (GLOVE)
- [ ] Analyze collected data
    - [ ] Labeled attachment score by sentence length 
    - [x] Labeled F-score by dependency length
    - [x] Labeled F-score by distance to root
    - [ ] Labeled precision and recall for non-projective dependencies
    - [x] Accuracies on different parts of speech
    - [ ] Test what happens if we just use one LSTM on the graph based parser on PP depth. 
    - [ ] What is the effect of using external BERT embeddings on the performance of the parser?
